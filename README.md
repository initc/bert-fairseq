# Introduction

This is a PyTorch version of (fairseq)[https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/fairseq] With some modifications made by Xiaoma Wu.BUPT.

this respository implement BERT and MulitPointer-generator on the basis of fairseq. 

My implementation references the (@Huggingface)[https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT] Code.
